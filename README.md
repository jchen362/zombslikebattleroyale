# zombslikebattleroyale
My attempt at creating a battle royale. I used firebase to enable mulitplayer. <br>

Controls:
WASD for movement <br>
LEFT CLICK to shoot <br>
SPACE + LEFT Click to place down a wall <br>

It is a bit laggy because the server (realtime database from firebase) is not the best in terms of latency and performance. <br>
